# personal-portfolio-2

This is a forked repo from ZainRK and I modified his template so I could make it into a quick and easy portfolio page.

I used react.js, sass, vite.js, framer.motion, reactDOM, NPM, and git to make this project work.

/////////////////

 probably should practice some more basic javascript functions like .map(), .reduce(), and .slice() before I start on making my next project.
